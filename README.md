# Audio-Converter
## Requirements
[FFMPEG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows/)  
If you don't feel safe using the provided exe file you can use the python source file instead, just make sure you have the following modules (I recommend using pip to quickly install them):  
tkinter - used for GUI  
pydub - used for conversion  
os - used for getting file path  <-- This one is Built in so no installing needed
## How to use  
It's a simple program you just have to select the files you want to convert, select the format you want to convert into and click the "Convert Files!" button (the CMD windows are FFMPEG doing its thing)  
***The converted file will be created in the same folder the chosen file is***
